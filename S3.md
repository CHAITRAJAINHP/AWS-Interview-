Let‚Äôs dive deep into AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) and cover all key concepts, real-time use cases, and interview Q&A in a clear, structured, and job-ready way.

üóÇÔ∏è AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) - Master Guide
üîπ What is S3?
AWS S3 is an object storage service that provides:

Scalable storage

Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)

High availability

Pay-as-you-go model

üì¶ Core Concepts
1. Bucket
Top-level container in S3

Globally unique name

Stores objects (files)

2. Objects
Files stored in S3

Consist of:

Data

Metadata

Unique key (filename/path)

3. Key
Unique identifier for the object within a bucket

e.g., images/user1/pic.jpg

4. Region
Buckets are created in specific AWS regions

Helps in latency optimization & compliance

5. Storage Classes
Class	Use Case
S3 Standard	Frequently accessed data
S3 Intelligent-Tiering	Automatically moves between tiers
S3 Standard-IA	Infrequently accessed data
S3 One Zone-IA	Cheaper IA storage in a single AZ
S3 Glacier	Archival storage (minutes‚Äìhours to access)
S3 Glacier Deep Archive	Cheapest, long-term archive (12 hours to access)

üõ°Ô∏è Security Concepts
6. Bucket Policy
JSON policy at the bucket level

Controls who can access the bucket and how

7. IAM Policy
Attached to users/roles

Controls S3 access permissions

8. ACL (Access Control List) (Legacy)
Object-level permissions

Not recommended for new setups

9. S3 Block Public Access
Blocks public access at the bucket/account level

Highly recommended for security

10. Encryption
At Rest: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C

In Transit: HTTPS

üîÑ Advanced Features
11. Versioning
Keeps multiple versions of the same object

Helps recover from accidental deletes

12. Lifecycle Rules
Automate transition to cheaper storage

Auto-delete old versions

13. Object Lock
Write Once, Read Many (WORM)

Prevents deletes for a retention period

14. S3 Replication
Cross-Region or Same-Region

Automatic replication of objects for redundancy or compliance

15. Presigned URLs
Temporary access to private objects

Generated using IAM credentials

16. S3 Events
Triggers Lambda, SNS, SQS on object events (PUT, DELETE)

‚öôÔ∏è S3 Performance and Cost Optimization
Multipart Uploads: For large files (>100MB)

Transfer Acceleration: Fast upload via CloudFront edge locations

Requester Pays: Bucket owner doesn‚Äôt pay for downloads

Intelligent-Tiering: Automatic cost savings for changing access patterns

üî• Real-Time Use Cases
Use Case	Description
Static Website Hosting	Serve HTML, JS, CSS directly from S3
Backup and Archiving	Store DB backups, logs, audit files
Media Processing	Store and trigger Lambda on video/image upload
Data Lake	Centralized repository for structured/unstructured data
Log Storage	Store CloudTrail, ALB/ELB logs for auditing

üí¨ Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: What is S3 and how is it different from EBS/EFS?
A: S3 is object storage, ideal for storing unstructured data like images, logs, backups. EBS is block storage (used by EC2), and EFS is file storage (POSIX-compliant, scalable NFS for Linux workloads).

Q2: What is the default consistency model of S3?
A: S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUTs and DELETEs.

Q3: What are some common security practices in S3?
Enable S3 Block Public Access

Use SSE-KMS for encryption

Enforce IAM policies with least privilege

Enable CloudTrail for audit logging

Q4: How do you automate the movement of data between storage classes?
A: Use Lifecycle policies to transition objects from Standard to IA/Glacier after X days and optionally delete after Y days.

Q5: How do you provide secure, temporary access to S3 objects?
A: Generate a pre-signed URL using SDK/CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 presign s3://mybucket/myfile.jpg --expires-in 300
Q6: Explain S3 Event Notifications
A: You can configure a bucket to send notifications to Lambda, SNS, or SQS when objects are created or deleted. Commonly used for real-time image processing, data pipelines, etc.

Q7: What‚Äôs the difference between Bucket Policy and IAM Policy?
Bucket Policy: Applied to the bucket itself

IAM Policy: Applied to users or roles

Q8: What is S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)?
A: Automatically replicates new objects from one bucket to another in a different region. Useful for disaster recovery and compliance.

Q9: How do you host a static website using S3?
Enable ‚ÄúStatic Website Hosting‚Äù in bucket settings

Upload index.html

Make the bucket public

Access via the endpoint provided by AWS

üìã AWS CLI S3 Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 ls                     # List buckets
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://my-bucket/  # Upload file
aws s3 sync ./folder s3://my-bucket/  # Sync folders
aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/file.txt    # Delete object
