🚀 What is AWS Auto Scaling?
AWS Auto Scaling helps you automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances (or other resources) to maintain performance and reduce costs.

It ensures that your application always has the right capacity to handle traffic.

📦 Key Components
Component	Description
Launch Template	Defines EC2 instance configuration (AMI, type, security groups, etc.)
Auto Scaling Group (ASG)	Manages a group of EC2s and controls scaling
Scaling Policies	Rules to scale out/in based on metrics
Health Checks	Automatically replaces unhealthy instances
Lifecycle Hooks	Add custom actions when instance launches/terminates

🔄 How It Works (Simplified)
You define a Launch Template or Launch Configuration.

Create an Auto Scaling Group with:

Min, Max, Desired Capacity

Subnets and Load Balancer

Attach Scaling Policies (manual, scheduled, dynamic).

CloudWatch monitors the metrics (e.g., CPU).

Auto Scaling adds/removes EC2s based on rules.

📈 Scaling Types
✅ Dynamic Scaling
Scales based on metrics like:

CPU Utilization

Memory (via CloudWatch agent)

ALB Request Count per Target

➡️ Target Tracking
Keep metric at a target value (e.g., CPU at 60%).

➡️ Step Scaling
Scale with defined steps (e.g., +2 EC2s if CPU > 80%).

➡️ Simple Scaling
Trigger based on one alarm.

📆 Scheduled Scaling
Set capacity in advance for known traffic patterns.

Ex: Increase EC2s to 6 every day at 9 AM.

🧑‍💻 Manual Scaling
Set Desired Capacity manually.

}
📍 Real-Time Use Case
E-commerce site on EC2 gets more traffic during flash sales.

Use ASG with 2 min – 10 max EC2s.

Attach Application Load Balancer.

Define target tracking for 60% CPU.

Auto Scaling adds/removes EC2s to maintain performance.

🧠 Auto Scaling Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: What is an Auto Scaling Group?
A:
A logical group of EC2 instances managed by AWS Auto Scaling. It handles instance scaling (in/out) based on policies.

Q2: What are lifecycle hooks in ASG?
A:
They allow custom actions before launching or before terminating an instance.

Ex: Run a script to install packages during instance startup.

Q3: What’s the difference between Launch Configuration and Launch Template?
Launch Configuration	Launch Template
Legacy	Recommended
No version control	Version control
No support for newer features (e.g. T2 Unlimited)	Full support

Q4: How does health check replacement work in ASG?
A:
If an EC2 instance fails health check (EC2 or ELB-based), ASG terminates it and launches a new one.

Q5: What is cooldown in Auto Scaling?
A:
Cooldown is a period to prevent additional scaling actions until the previous one completes.

Q6: Can we attach multiple load balancers to an ASG?
A:
Yes. ASG supports:

Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Network Load Balancer (NLB)

You can attach multiple target groups to one ASG.

Q7: What’s the difference between Target Tracking and Step Scaling?
Feature	Target Tracking	Step Scaling
Behavior	Maintains a target metric	Scales in steps based on alarm
Simpler setup	Yes	No (more complex tuning)
Use case	Keep CPU at 60%	Scale by +2 EC2s if CPU > 80%

🔐 Best Practices
✅ Use Launch Templates instead of Launch Configs
✅ Always enable detailed monitoring
✅ Use target tracking for most use cases
✅ Set cooldowns to avoid rapid scaling
✅ Test with scheduled scaling during load testing

⚙️ Hands-On Demo (CLI)
Create Launch Template:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws ec2 create-launch-template \
  --launch-template-name my-template \
  --version-description "v1" \
  --launch-template-data '{
      "ImageId":"ami-1234567890abcdef0",
      "InstanceType":"t3.micro",
      "SecurityGroupIds":["sg-abc123"]
  }'
Create Auto Scaling Group:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group \
  --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --launch-template "LaunchTemplateName=my-template,Version=1" \
  --min-size 2 \
  --max-size 5 \
  --desired-capacity 2 \
  --vpc-zone-identifier "subnet-aaa,subnet-bbb"
