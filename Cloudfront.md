üßä AWS CloudFront ‚Äî Global CDN (Content Delivery Network)
‚úÖ What is CloudFront?
CloudFront is a CDN service that caches your content in edge locations around the world so users can access it faster from the location closest to them.

üì¶ Use Cases:
Deliver static websites (HTML, CSS, JS)

Cache and accelerate S3-hosted content

Stream video with low latency

Use signed URLs to protect private content

‚öôÔ∏è Key Components:
Component	Description
Origin	Source of truth (S3, EC2, ALB, etc.)
Edge Locations	600+ global PoPs (Points of Presence)
Distribution	Configuration object for delivering content
Cache Behavior	Rules for caching and routing content
TTL (Time to Live)	Time to keep objects cached
Invalidations	Force cache refresh if content is updated
Signed URLs / Cookies	Control access to private content

üõ†Ô∏è Demo Scenario:
You have:

A static website hosted in S3

Users from India, UK, US

Without CloudFront ‚Üí Users hit S3 (slower)

With CloudFront ‚Üí Cached at edge ‚Üí Lightning fast ‚ö°

bash
Copy
Edit
aws cloudfront create-distribution \
  --origin-domain-name your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
üîê Security:
HTTPS (SSL) at edge

Can use WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Origin Access Control (OAC) to restrict S3 bucket only to CloudFront

üìä Real-Time DevOps Use:
CloudFront + S3 = Scalable Website

CloudFront + ALB = Low-latency app front

CloudFront + Lambda@Edge = Customize responses globally

üí¨ Interview Q&A (CloudFront)
Q1: Why use CloudFront over direct S3 access?

Because it caches your content closer to the user, reducing latency and improving performance.

Q2: Can CloudFront deliver dynamic content?

Yes, but it shines with static content. For dynamic, it forwards to the origin directly (like an ALB or EC2).

Q3: How to invalidate content?

bash
Copy
Edit
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id EXXXXXXX \
  --paths "/*"
üåç AWS Global Accelerator ‚Äî Global TCP/UDP Accelerator
‚úÖ What is Global Accelerator?
A network acceleration service that routes your TCP/UDP traffic over the AWS global backbone instead of the public internet.

üì¶ Use Cases:
Speed up global application access (gaming, VoIP, VPN)

Improve reliability with health checks + failover

Global apps with multi-region failover

‚ö° Difference from CloudFront
Feature	CloudFront	Global Accelerator
Protocol	HTTP/HTTPS	TCP/UDP
Focus	Static/dynamic web content	Any TCP/UDP app
Use Case	Web acceleration & caching	Gaming, VoIP, low latency backend
Edge Routing	At HTTP Layer	At Network Layer
Health Checks	No (uses origin's)	Yes (GA checks each endpoint)

üß™ Real-Time Demo Example:
Deploy ALBs in two regions: us-east-1 and ap-south-1

Attach both to a Global Accelerator

GA assigns 2 static anycast IPs

Traffic goes to closest healthy region

  --endpoint-configurations EndpointId=ALB_ARN,Weight=128
üîê Security & Reliability
Supports DDoS protection

Health checks for endpoints

Fast failover if region goes down

üí¨ Interview Q&A (Global Accelerator)
Q1: How is GA different from Route 53 latency routing?

GA uses AWS's global network to improve performance; Route 53 just chooses the closest region, then uses the public internet.

Q2: Can GA be used with EC2 and ALB?

Yes, both. GA routes to ALB, NLB, or EC2 IPs across multiple regions.

Q3: Does GA cache content like CloudFront?

No. GA just routes at the network level. No caching or content delivery.

üîÅ Summary Table
