📦 AWS EBS – Elastic Block Store
🚀 What is AWS EBS?
EBS provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances.

Think of it like a virtual hard disk that you can attach to your virtual machine (EC2).

It’s persistent (data remains after reboot/stop).

🔑 Key EBS Concepts
Feature	Details
Type	Block Storage
Attachment	Attached to 1 EC2 instance (multi-attach only with specific types)
Durability	99.999% availability
Snapshot	Point-in-time backup stored in S3
Encryption	KMS encryption for data-at-rest
Volume Types	gp2, gp3, io1, io2, st1, sc1

📊 EBS Volume Types & Use Cases
Type	Description	Use Case
gp2	General Purpose SSD	Default, good for general apps
gp3	New SSD, customizable IOPS & throughput	Better performance & lower cost
io1/io2	Provisioned IOPS SSD	Databases needing high IOPS
st1	Throughput optimized HDD	Big data, logs
sc1	Cold HDD	Infrequent access, backups

🔁 EBS Snapshots
Stored in S3 (you don’t see them in the S3 bucket).

Used for backups, creating AMIs, and restoring volumes.

Incremental: Only changed blocks are saved, saving storage cost.

✅ Real-Time Use Case: EBS
You run a MySQL database on EC2. You use an EBS gp3 volume for performance and take nightly snapshots for backup.

🧠 EBS Interview Questions
Q1: What’s the difference between EBS and Instance Store?
A:

EBS is persistent storage, survives stop/start.

Instance Store is ephemeral, data is lost on stop/terminate.

Q2: Can you attach an EBS volume to multiple instances?
A:

Normally no.

Only io1/io2 volumes support Multi-Attach and only with Nitro-based EC2 instances in the same AZ.

Q3: What is the use of EBS Snapshots?
A:

Backup

Restore volumes in case of failure

Migrate volumes across regions

Create new volumes from the snapshot

Q4: Difference between gp2 and gp3?

gp2	gp3
IOPS based on volume size	Custom IOPS & throughput
Max 16,000 IOPS	Max 16,000 IOPS, 1,000 MB/s
More expensive at scale	Cost-effective

📂 AWS EFS – Elastic File System
📘 What is AWS EFS?
Fully managed file system (NFS protocol).

Can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.

Automatically scales up/down storage.

🔑 Key Features of EFS
Feature	Details
Type	File storage (vs. block for EBS)
Access	Multiple EC2s across AZs
Scalability	Automatically grows/shrinks
Durability	Highly available, multi-AZ
Encryption	Supports encryption at rest & transit
Performance Modes	General Purpose (default), Max I/O

💡 EFS Use Case
You have an application running on an Auto Scaling Group with 4 EC2 instances. All need to read/write to the same file system (e.g., image uploads).
Use EFS so all EC2s share the same data.

🧠 EFS Interview Questions
Q1: What is the difference between EBS and EFS?

Feature	EBS	EFS
Type	Block Storage	File Storage (NFS)
Access	1 EC2 (usually)	Multiple EC2s simultaneously
Scaling	Manual	Automatic
Best for	Databases, logs, apps	Shared web apps, home dirs
Protocol	Block Device	NFSv4

Q2: Does EFS work with Windows?
A: No. EFS supports Linux only, because it uses the NFS protocol.

Q3: How is EFS billed?
A:

You pay for storage used (GB/month).

Two storage classes:

Standard

EFS Infrequent Access (IA) for cost savings on rarely accessed data

Q4: Can I mount EFS in multiple AZs or VPCs?

A:

Yes, EFS is regional, so it works across AZs.

To use across VPCs, use Transit Gateway or VPC Peering.

🔐 Security Tips (EBS + EFS)
Always enable KMS encryption for sensitive data.

Use IAM policies + Security Groups to restrict access.

Mount EFS using TLS for encryption in transit.
