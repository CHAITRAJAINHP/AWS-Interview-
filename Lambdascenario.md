 Scenario: Image Upload and Compression Pipeline
“When a user uploads an image to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function is automatically triggered. The Lambda compresses the image and stores it in another S3 bucket.”

🔧 Tools Involved
Service	Role
Amazon S3	Stores uploaded and processed images
AWS Lambda	Processes (compresses) the image
IAM Role	Grants Lambda permissions
CloudWatch Logs	Logs Lambda execution for debugging
(Optional) SNS/SQS	For alerts or async processing

🪜 Step-by-Step Process (with Technical Details)
🔹 Step 1: User Uploads Image to S3
You have an S3 bucket called image-upload-source.

A frontend/mobile app or CLI uploads an image:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp mypic.jpg s3://image-upload-source/
🔹 Step 2: S3 Triggers Lambda
You set up an S3 Event Notification for the bucket.

Trigger is configured for ObjectCreated events.

Edit
{
  "LambdaFunctionConfigurations": [
    {
      "Id": "ImageUploadTrigger",
      "Events": ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"],
      "LambdaFunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account:function:CompressImageFunction"
    }
  ]
}
🔹 Step 3: Lambda Function Executes
Lambda receives an event with the image file’s S3 path.

It:

Downloads the file using boto3 (Python AWS SDK)

Compresses the image using a library like Pillow

Uploads the new image to another bucket image-upload-processed

Sample Lambda Code (Python):

python
Copy
Edit
import boto3
from PIL import Image
import io

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Extract bucket and key
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Download the image
    image_obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    image_data = image_obj['Body'].read()
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_data))

    # Compress image
    compressed_io = io.BytesIO()
    image.save(compressed_io, format='JPEG', quality=50)
    compressed_io.seek(0)

    # Upload to destination bucket
    s3.put_object(Bucket='image-upload-processed', Key=key, Body=compressed_io)
    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Image compressed and uploaded'}
🔹 Step 4: CloudWatch Logs Record Everything
Every execution is logged

If Lambda fails (e.g., corrupt file), logs help debug the issue

🔐 IAM Role Required
Lambda must have the right permissions:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::image-upload-source/*",
    "arn:aws:s3:::image-upload-processed/*"
  ]
}
🎯 Why This is a Perfect Interview Use Case?
✅ Key Concepts Covered:
Event-driven architecture

S3 to Lambda triggers

Image processing inside Lambda

Cross-bucket access

Logging and observability

IAM role configuration

Serverless scalability (auto handles 100s of images)

📋 How to Explain in Interview (Sample Answer)
"I built a serverless image processing pipeline using S3 and Lambda. When a user uploads an image to an S3 bucket, it automatically triggers a Lambda function. The Lambda fetches the image, compresses it using the Pillow library in Python, and stores the optimized version in another S3 bucket. I used an IAM role to allow access between Lambda and both S3 buckets. Everything is logged in CloudWatch, which helps monitor and debug failures. This solution is fully serverless and scalable, with no infrastructure to manage."

💡 Optional Enhancements (Bonus Points!)
Feature	Why Add It?
SNS notification	Alert users after processing
SQS queue	Buffer uploads if Lambda gets overwhelmed
Step Functions	Chain multiple steps (e.g., watermark + resize)
DynamoDB	Track metadata like upload timestamp or user
