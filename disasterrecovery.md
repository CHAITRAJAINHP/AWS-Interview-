master Disaster Recovery (DR) on AWS, including RPO, RTO, DR strategies, and real-world examples to help you crack interviews with confidence.

☁️ What is Disaster Recovery (DR) on AWS?
Disaster Recovery is the strategy to ensure business continuity and minimal downtime or data loss during unexpected events like:

Region failures

Data corruption

Application outages

Natural disasters

Ransomware or cyberattacks

🧮 RPO and RTO
Term	Stands For	Meaning	Example
RPO	Recovery Point Objective	How much data can you afford to lose (i.e., the time between the last backup and the failure)?	RPO = 15 mins → max data loss is 15 minutes
RTO	Recovery Time Objective	How fast you must recover after failure	RTO = 1 hour → systems must be up in 1 hour

🎯 Think: RPO = "How much can I afford to lose?" and RTO = "How fast can I get back?"

🧰 4 AWS DR Strategies (from least to most expensive & fast)
Strategy	Cost	RTO	RPO	Use Case
1. Backup & Restore	💸 Low	⏱️ High	📉 Low	Long-term archival, less critical apps
2. Pilot Light	💰 Medium	⏱️ Medium	📉 Low	Core components ready, rest launched on demand
3. Warm Standby	💵 Higher	⏱️ Low	📉 Low	Pre-running minimal system in another region
4. Multi-Site (Hot/Active-Active)	💸💸 Highest	⏱️ Near-zero	📉 Near-zero	Mission-critical, high-availability systems

🔎 Deep Dive into Each Strategy
1️⃣ Backup & Restore
Steps:

Regular backups (Amazon S3, Glacier, AWS Backup)

On disaster: restore manually to new region/account

Services:

Amazon S3 + S3 Glacier for backups

AWS Backup

Amazon RDS Snapshots

Pros: Cheapest
Cons: Longest downtime (RTO high)

✅ Use for: Internal apps, low-traffic workloads

2️⃣ Pilot Light
Definition: Minimal core services are always running (e.g., DB, load balancer), but app servers are turned on only during disaster.

Steps:

Keep DB (like RDS) & IAM roles replicated

When disaster hits, launch EC2/containers & scale

Tools:

AMIs for EC2

CloudFormation or Terraform

AWS DRS (Disaster Recovery Service)

✅ Use for: Mid-critical workloads

3️⃣ Warm Standby
Definition: A scaled-down version of the production environment runs in another region — ready to take traffic after scaling up.

Steps:

DB sync (RDS Multi-AZ or Cross-Region Read Replicas)

Services partially running (e.g., 2 of 10 EC2)

Route 53 failover routing policy

Pros: Faster recovery
Cons: Higher cost due to resource duplication

✅ Use for: Financial apps, e-commerce

4️⃣ Multi-Site (Active-Active)
Definition: Full-production replicas in 2+ regions. Both serve traffic.

Steps:

Active AWS regions

Load balanced via Route 53

Data replicated in near real-time

Tools:

Amazon Aurora Global DB

Route 53 Geolocation / Latency-based routing

AWS Global Accelerator

✅ Use for: Banking, Healthcare, Government portals

🧠 AWS Services for DR
Service	Purpose
S3 + S3 Glacier	Long-term backup storage
AWS Backup	Centralized backup service
RDS Snapshots	Point-in-time DB recovery
AWS DRS	Automated disaster recovery (lift & shift)
CloudEndure	Legacy DR service (now AWS DRS)
Route 53	DNS failover
CloudFormation	Infra recovery templates
AWS Organizations	Account-level isolation & governance
Cross-Region Replication (CRR)	For S3, DynamoDB, RDS
SNS & CloudWatch	Alerts, failover triggers

🧩 Real-Time Use Case
🏥 Healthcare Application with RPO = 0 & RTO < 1 min
Deployed in us-east-1 and us-west-2

Aurora Global DB for cross-region DB replication

Route 53 with latency-based routing

ALB in both regions

ECS Fargate running in both regions (Active-Active)

CloudWatch triggers SNS in case of outage

Result: Even if us-east-1 fails, users are automatically served from us-west-2

💬 Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: What is RPO and RTO?
A:

RPO (Recovery Point Objective): How much data you can afford to lose.

RTO (Recovery Time Objective): How quickly you can restore after failure.

Q2: Explain the Pilot Light strategy.
A:
Pilot Light keeps the core components (like DB, IAM roles) running, and the rest (like EC2, app layer) is launched only during a disaster. It balances cost and recovery speed.

Q3: Difference between Warm Standby and Multi-Site?
Warm Standby	Multi-Site
Partial infra always on	Full infra active in both
Needs scaling on failover	No scaling needed
Lower cost	High cost
RTO: Minutes	RTO: Seconds

Q4: How does AWS help implement Backup & Restore strategy?
A:

Use AWS Backup for centralized backups

Store backups in S3 or Glacier

Use CloudFormation to restore infra quickly

Use RDS snapshots or EBS snapshots

Q5: How would you implement DR for an EC2-based app with an RTO of <1 hour?
A:

Use Pilot Light or Warm Standby

Pre-create AMIs for app servers

Keep DB in RDS with cross-region replication

Automate recovery with CloudFormation & Route 53 failover
